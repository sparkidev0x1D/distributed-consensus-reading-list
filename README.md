# Distributed Consensus Reading List üìö

Since its inception in the 1980s, [distributed consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)) has been the subject of extensive academic research. Whilst definitions vary, [distributed consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)) (or equivalently, [atomic broadcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_broadcast)) most often refers to the problem of how to decide an ordered sequence of values between a set of distributed nodes. This can be used to implement an append-only replicated log which can be utilized either directly or indirectly, to provide services such as primary backup replication or [state machine replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication). These abstractions can, in turn, form the building blocks of new abstractions, such as a distributed [key-value store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key‚Äìvalue_database). Some consensus algorithms instead decide only a single value or a partially ordered sequence of values.
What unifies distributed consensus algorithms is the fact that they are always safe, regardless of delays and crashes (though they are not necessarily [Byzantine fault tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault)), and are guaranteed to make progress provided sufficient liveness.

This is a long list of papers relating to distributed consensus. Many of the papers listed below fit into more than one section. However, for simplicity, each paper is listed only in the most relevant section. Where possible, open access links for each paper have been provided.

  * This paper describes how to replace acceptors in Paxos with disks
  * Each disk is divided into blocks, one for each proposer. Each proposer may only write to its own block and read from other blocks, which they do in each of the two usual Paxos phases
  * Each block contains the rough equivalent to last promised ballot number and last accepted proposal for the assigned proposer

* Fast Paxos, Distributed Computing 2006 [[pdf](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tr-2005-112.pdf)]
  * Variant of Paxos where proposers can bypass the leader by allowing multiple values to be proposed in the same ballot. This requires stronger quorums intersection, e.g. fast paxos needs 3/4 of acceptors (instead of a simple majority) to provide the same liveness guarantees as classic Paxos.

  * Variant of Paxos which replaces the one leader with a group of leaders. Clients send operations to all leaders and they all propose values to the acceptors. Acceptors only accept a value if they have received proposals from a quorum of leaders. Similar to the non-equivocation phase in BFT. Liveness now does not depend on the leader.

### Consensus for geo-distributed systems
This section covers papers describing consensus algorithms for WANs and/or geo-replicated systems. Many of these algorithms (such as [EPaxos](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/epaxos-sosp2013.pdf)) are leaderless and decide a partial-ordering over values instead of the more traditional total-ordering approach.

* Megastore: Providing Scalable, Highly Available Storage for Interactive Services, CIDR 2011 [[pdf](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2011/Papers/CIDR11_Paper32.pdf)]
  * Megastore uses SMR with witnesses, replicas that participate in log replication but do not run a state machine and read-only replicas that only run a state machine. This paper seems to use an unusual definition of Multi-Paxos where each instance is district but the 1a/1b messages for slot i is piggybacked onto 2a2/b for slot i-1.

  * Widely utilized Apache licensed open source project written in Java [project website](https://zookeeper.apache.org)
  * [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) uses Zookeeper, as well as its own replication protocol, by described [here](https://www.confluent.io/blog/distributed-consensus-reloaded-apache-zookeeper-and-replication-in-kafka/). This is no longer true.
  * Architecture is similar to Google's Chubby but unlike Chubby is described in detail and is open source
  * Writes are linearizable, reads may be stale. Note: calling sync before a read doesn't make it linearizable
  * Clients may have multiple outstanding requests, they will be handled FIFO
  * Uses primary-backup replication instead of state machine replication
